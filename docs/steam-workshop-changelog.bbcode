[h1]Phobos' Chemistry Pathways — Changelog[/h1]

[h2]v0.24.0 — In-Game Guide & Changelog Popups (2026-02-23)[/h2]

[h3]New Features[/h3]
[list]
[*] [b]Welcome Guide[/b] — First-time tutorial popup on new characters explaining PCP's chemistry pathways, sandbox options, and getting started. "Don't show again" checkbox with per-character persistence.

[/list]

[h3]Critical Bug Fixes[/h3]
[list]
[*] [b]FluidContainer -fluid binding cascade[/b] — Fixed 4 cascading CTDs caused by B42 -fluid input rules. Wildcards ([*]) before -fluid lines greedily matched FluidContainer items, stealing them from designated input slots. 13 hotFluidContainer recipes now use tags[base:cookable] instead.
[*] [b]base:smallblade NPE[/b] — Replaced invalid weapon Category tag with correct ItemTags (base:sharpknife;base:scissors) in PCPCutPlasticScrap. The old tag caused an NPE CTD on world load.
[*] Invalid item IDs in mixer recipes corrected (Base.Blackpowder, Base.WoodVinegar)
[*] Mixer recipe -fluid input ordering fixed for B42 constraints
[*] MineralFeedSupplement ConditionMax corrected from 1 to 100
[*] Workstation translation keys added for PCP_ConcreteMixer
[*] Guide popup colour tag spacing fixed
