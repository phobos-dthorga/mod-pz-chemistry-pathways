A complete chemistry suite for Project Zomboid Build 42, adding realistic crafting pathways for blackpowder, biodiesel, soap, bone char, agriculture, recycling, and advanced laboratory processes.

[h2]Features[/h2]

[h3]Applied Chemistry Skill System[/h3]
Custom Applied Chemistry perk with a steeper XP curve (75-9000). Two occupations (Chemist and Pharmacist) and two traits (Chemistry Enthusiast and Chemical Aversion) provide starting skill bonuses. Five skill book volumes cover levels 1-10. All 198 recipes award Applied Chemistry XP with 7 tiers of skill requirements.

[h3]Blackpowder Pathway[/h3]
Seven-step chain from raw charcoal to gunpowder: crush, purify (water or alkaline wash), prepare compost, extract battery acid, extract sulphur, synthesize potassium nitrate, and mix blackpowder.

[h3]Biodiesel Pathway[/h3]
Five-step chain from raw crops to refined vehicle fuel. Extract oil from 6 crop types (soybeans, sunflower, corn, flax, hemp, peanuts) using 3 equipment tiers (mortar and pestle, chemistry set, metal drum). Transesterify with methanol and KOH or NaOH catalyst, water-wash, and refine into usable fuel.

[h3]Fat Rendering & Oil Conversion[/h3]
Render lard, butter, or margarine into biodiesel feedstock. Slow-cook butchered meat cuts (6 pieces to 2 jars of rendered fat + bone scraps) in a cooking pot — a renewable fat source from animal husbandry. Convert bottled vegetable or olive oil directly.

[h3]Soap-Making[/h3]
Two soap pathways: glycerol-based crude soap from biodiesel by-products, and traditional fat-based soap from rendered animal fats. Both support KOH and NaOH catalysts.

[h3]Bone Char Production[/h3]
Pyrolyse animal bones and skulls in metal drums to produce bone char, an alternative to purified charcoal in filtration and reagent recipes.

[h3]Recycling Pathway[/h3]
Nine-step recycling chain: wood tar to wood glue and tar-pitch torches, calcite to quicklime and fertilizer, crude soap to usable bars and sterilized bandages, lead scrap to fishing tackle, plastic scrap to glue, and acid-washed electronics to precision components.

[h3]Agriculture & Downstream Applications[/h3]
Six pathways connecting chemistry intermediates to vanilla gameplay systems:
[list]
[*] [b]Garden Pest Sprays[/b] — Sulphur fungicide (Mildew), insecticidal soap (Aphids), potash foliar (Flies) — functional B42 crop cures
[*] [b]Mineral Feed Supplements[/b] — Bone char-based animal feed
[*] [b]Water Purification[/b] — Activated charcoal filters and purification tablets; gas mask filter recharging
[*] [b]Epoxy Resin[/b] — Synthesized from wood tar and glycerol
[*] [b]Fire-Starting[/b] — Lighter fluid, matchboxes, slug repellent
[*] [b]Chemical Processing[/b] — Leather tanning, plaster powder, wood vinegar
[/list]

[h3]Concrete Mixer Workstation[/h3]
Powered CraftBench entity for industrial-scale material processing. Build from a metal drum, salvaged motor, and welding equipment. Requires electricity (grid or generator). 13 recipes including concrete, mortar, reinforced concrete, and bulk chemistry operations. Generator fuel drain during crafting.

[h3]In-Game Guide & Changelog[/h3]
Welcome guide on first install with "Don't show again" option. Version-based "What's New" changelog popup on updates showing changes since your last played version.

[h3]Advanced Lab Equipment[/h3]
Centrifuge, chromatograph, microscope, and spectrometer recipes for enhanced processing. Microscope and spectrometer gated by sandbox option.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Optional Systems[/h2]

[h3]Impurity/Purity System[/h3]
Condition-based purity tracking (0-100%) through recipe chains. Equipment quality factors, severity scaling, yield penalties, and player feedback via speech bubbles and custom tooltips.

[h3]Health Hazard System[/h3]
Hazard system for 11 dangerous chemistry recipes. Each splits into Protected (mask + goggles required, filter degrades) and Unprotected (risk of disease or stat penalties) variants. Integrates with EHR when available.

[h3]Empty Vessel Replacement[/h3]
Empty PCP FluidContainers automatically revert to their vanilla vessel equivalents (mason jar + lid, bottle, bucket, gas can) when you open a container. MP-synced.

[h3]Tiered Reset/Cleanup[/h3]
Five one-shot sandbox options for version upgrades and mod removal. Strip purity data, forget recipes, reset skill XP, remove all PCP items, or nuclear reset. Each executes once then auto-resets to OFF.

[h2]Cross-Mod Integration[/h2]
[list]
[*] [b]ZScienceSkill[/b] ("Science, Bitch!") — Applied Chemistry XP mirrors to Science at 50% rate; 33 items + 8 fluids registered as microscope specimens
[*] [b]EHR[/b] (Extensive Health Rework) — Health hazard recipes dispatch EHR diseases instead of vanilla stat penalties
[*] [b]Dynamic Trading[/b] — 34 PCP items registered for NPC trading with custom "Chemical" tag and "Chemist" trader archetype; chemical allocations injected into 8 existing vendor archetypes
[*] [b]Neat Crafting[/b] — Recipe visibility filters applied through NC_FilterBar; runtime-detected, no hard dependency
